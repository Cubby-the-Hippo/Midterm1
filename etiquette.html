        <h2>Why its important:</h2>
        <p> As you become a more and more advanced skier not is knowing your way around the mountain crucial but also knowing and understanding the common etiquette and set of rules that all skiers abide by. Hopefully after reading this page you will have a much better understanding of how you can follow the common rules of the mountain to help keep you and others safer while skiing.</p>
        <h2>Getting On and Off the Chairlift</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>50% of all ski or snowboard related injuries happen either getting on or off the chairlift which is why its extremely important to understand how to properly navigate the lines and some tips for getting on and off.</li>
            <li>Most resorts there will be sectioned off areas for the lift lines but if not try and stay out of areas with downhill traffic as you wait. Once you get through the line wait until its your groups turn and then slide foreward to the line and wait for the chair, when its right beneath you sit down into it and remember to put the bar down.</li>
            <li>As you get off remember to put the safety bar up and keep your ski tips up as you come into the landing area. Then when its time stand up and push off from the chair making sure that you dont crash into any one from your chairs group or people in front of you.</li>

        <h2>On The Mountain:</h2>
        <h2>Merging and entering Runs:</h2>
        <p>One place with lots of injurys is runs that merge together as skiers's often dont see each other and crash. As you merge be sure to look around you and up the merging run to make sure you can continue.The same apply's when you are entering a new run, you dont have right of way and so make sure it is safe for you to enter before going.</p>
        <h2>Cat-Tracks:</h2>
        <p>Cat-tracks are one of the main routes that skiers use to traverse across the mountain or get to a different section of the resort. As a general rule the people on the cat-track have the right of way and so if you are entering wait until theres a safe opening, when you are exiting the right of way can be tricky so try and make sure you dont enter anyone elses path and youll be safe.</p>
        <h2> Chairlifts:</h2>
        <p>As i mentioned above this can be a dangerous area so make sure to be cuatuis as you aproach the lift lines and make sure to watch out for out of control skiers making a sprint for the lifts</p>

        <h2>Ski Lodge</h2>
        <p> Whether you headed into the lodge for lunch or as you finish your day at the bottom of the mountain this can always be a dangerous place as people will often come speeding right up to the lodge doging and swerving through the crowds. As you get close try to slow down and when you find an open space stop and take off your skis, remember to pick them up and put them on the rack instead of leaving them planted in the snow as they could blow away or get taken.</p>
