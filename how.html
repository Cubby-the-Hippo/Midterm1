        <h2>Step 1: Gather your gear and aparel </h2>
        <p> One of the most important parts of skiing in general is having the propper gear and attire so before reading the rest of this page look over the next to pages in this website that talk about different types of ski's and where to get ski clothing from.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: Basic Movements and Recovery</h2>
        <p> Now that you have all the proper clothing and gear you'll need for the mountain put your ski's on and make your way over to the flat area or magic carpet. Here is where you are going to want to practice the basic motions of skiing that instructors call pizza and french fry. When you want to go forewards you will aim your feet down the hill parallel to each other so they look like french fries. When its time to slow down you will shift the weight in your feet so you are pushing them away from each other and as the tips of your skis tilt towards each other, slowing you down, they will be in a traingular pizza shape. </p>

        <h2>Step 3: Turning and Stopping</h2>
        <p> Now that you have the basic motions of stopping and skiing down hill under control its time to learn how to turn and hockey stop. Once you feel confortable enough as you ski downhill try to shift the weight onto either your right foot and as you press into the front of your right boot you should start to turn, then to turn the other way shift the weight onto your left foot and press into your boot. Now that you can turn you'll start to move faster and so instead of stopping with the pizza quickly shift all your weight onto one foot and do whats called a hockey stop where you turn your skies across the run and push down. </p>

        <h2>Step 4: Getting up and down the mountain</h2>
        <p> Once you fee confident in your abillitys to safely go down the flat part of mountain while turning and maintaining your speed the next step is to get on the chairlift and go ski an actuall run. Suprisingly a large number of skiing injuries happen on the chairlifts  make sure to get on safely and keep your ski tips up as you get off at the top. Once your at the top you'll notice that next to the runs names there are colored shapes, these describe the runs difficulty which is explained on the mountain guide page but as a rule of thumb only ski the green runs for your first day. Now that you've made it to the top of the run remember what you've learned and go have fun. Make sure NOT TO CRASH.</p>

        <h2>Step 5: Practice A LOT!!</h2>
        <p>Getting better at skiing, alike many other sports, all depends on how much you practice and how willing you are to try new things. Even for someone like me who has been skiing all my life not only are there still new things for me to learn and try but the more i practice the better i get and the more fun i have. </p>
