            <h2>Step 1: Gather Your Gear and Apparel</h2>
            <p>One of the most important parts of skiing is having the proper gear and attire. Before reading the rest of this page, check the other pages on this website that discuss different types of skis and where to get ski clothing.</p>

            <h2>Step 2: Basic Movements and Recovery</h2>
            <p>Now that you have the proper clothing and gear, put on your skis and make your way to a flat area or magic carpet. Here, practice the basic motions of skiing: the "pizza" and "french fry." To go forward, aim your feet down the hill parallel to each other (like french fries). To slow down, shift your weight outward so your skis form a triangular "pizza" shape.</p>

            <h2>Step 3: Turning and Stopping</h2>
            <p>Now that you have the basic motions down, it's time to learn how to turn and stop. When skiing downhill, shift your weight to your right foot to turn right, and to your left foot to turn left. For stopping, quickly shift your weight onto one foot and perform a "hockey stop" by turning your skis across the run and pushing down.</p>

            <h2>Step 4: Getting Up and Down the Mountain</h2>
            <p>Once you feel confident skiing on flat terrain while turning, it's time to ride the chairlift and tackle actual runs. Many skiing injuries occur on chairlifts, so ensure you get on and off safely. Look for colored shapes next to run names that indicate difficulty levels. Stick to green runs on your first day, and have fun while avoiding crashes!</p>

            <h2>Step 5: Practice A LOT!</h2>
            <p>Getting better at skiing, like many sports, depends on practice and a willingness to try new things. Even experienced skiers continue to learn and improve through practice.</p>
